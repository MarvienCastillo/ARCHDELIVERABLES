To use the CRUD operation API, first step is to clone the repository. This is important because
the codes will not work unless all the files and dependencies are installed.

## How to clone the repository
Open git bash and change the directory where you wanna clone this repository. Then type
```
git clone https://github.com/MarvienCastillo/ARCHDELIVERABLES.git
```
Once cloned, in your command line, run 
```
node app
```
